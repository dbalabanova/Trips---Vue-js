# Project Vue-JS
 Trips

## Idea
An app that stores useful information about trips to different destinations.

### 

There is a public part - Home page - when user is not registered or logged in, when logged in homepage with personal message.
If user wants to go to Trips when not logged in- he/she is redirected to login form.
when User is logged in he/she has access to trips list.
Logged in user can:
- create trip
- edit trip
- delete trip
Login user also can see his/her information in section my profile.

## Vuetify is used for nicer look 


## Vuelidate is used for validation
