# Project Vue-JS
 Trips

## Idea
An app that stores useful information about trips to different destinations.

### 

There is a public part - Home page - when user is not registered or logged in.
If user wants to go to Trips - he is redirected to login form.
when User is logged in he has access to all trips 
Logged in user can:
- create trip
- edit trip
- delete trip
